    "\n",
    "Features are instances of the abstract class `Feature` and are responsible for modifying images. For example, a feature might add the image of a particle or add some salt-and-pepper noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each implementation of the class `Feature` needs to define a method `get(image, **kwargs)`, which takes an image as an input and returns an updated image. This can be additive, such as adding a particle or Gaussian noise, or non-additive, such as introducing Poisson noise or performing a low-pass filter. The image that is modified is in itself an instance of the class `Image`, which for now can be thought of as a numpy ndarray (see also [image_example](image_example.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "When a feature is created, keyword arguments can be passed to its constructor. These arguments are stored as properties (as a PropertyDict) of the feature (see also [properties_example](properties_example.ipynb)), which determine how the feature is resolved. When a feature is updated using the method `.update()`, all properties are updated as well by calling their respective methods `.update()`. When a feature is resolved using the method `resolve(image)`, the current values of all properties are sent through the method `get(image, **kwargs)` as keyword arguments."
