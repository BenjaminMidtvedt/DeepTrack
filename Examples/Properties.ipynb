They represent a value,\nwhich can be of any data type. This value can be updated through a sampling rule which is\npassed to the class constructor on initialization. Concretely, a Property always has a value\naccessible through the `current_value` field. This value is updated whenever `update()` is\ncalled, and the new value is determined by the sampling rule passed as an input to the\nconstructor.\n\n## What is a sampling rule?\n\nA sampling rule, just like the `current_value` field, can be of any type. When a rule is\nsampled - that is, when you request it to create a new value - it runs through a series of \nchecks, seen below: "},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"def sample(self):\n    if hasmethod(sampling_rule, \"sample\"):\n        # If the ruleset itself implements a sample method,\n        # call it instead.\n        return sampling_rule.sample()\n\n    elif isinstance(sampling_rule, dict):\n        # If the ruleset is a dict, return a new dict with each\n        # element being sampled from the original dict.\n        out = {}\n        for key, val in self.sampling_rule.items():\n            if hasmethod(val, 'sample'):\n                out[key] = val.sample()\n            else:\n                out[key] = val\n        return out\n\n    elif isiterable(sampling_rule):\n        # If it's iterable, return the next value\n        return next(sampling_rule)\n        \n    elif callable(sampling_rule):\n        # If it's a function, call it without parameters\n        return sampling_rule()\n\n    elif (isinstance(sampling_rule, list) or\n            isinstance(sampling_rule, np.ndarray) and sampling_rule.ndim == 1):\n        # If it's either a list or a 1-dimensional ndarray,\n        # return a random element from the list. \n        return np.random.choice(sampling_rule)\n\n    else:\n        # Else, assume it's elementary.\n        return sampling_rule"}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
