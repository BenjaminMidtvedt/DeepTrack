    "## What is a feature?\n",
    "\n",
    "Features are instances of the abstract class `Feature` and are responsible for modifying images. Each implementation of the class `Feature` needs to define a method `get(image, **kwargs)`, takes an image as an input and should return an updated image. This can be additive, such as adding a particle or gaussian noise, or non-additive, such as poisson noise or a low-pass filter. The image that is modified is in itself an instance of the class Image, which for now can be thought of as a normal numpy ndarray.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is very important to note that features do _not_ create images, they modify images. As such, they always need an image as an input. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a feature is created, keyword arguments can be passed to its constructor. These arguments are stored as [properties](properties_example.ipynb) of the feature, which determine how the feature is resolved. When a feature is updated using the method `update()`, all of the properties are updated as well. When a feature is resolved using the method `resolve(image)`, the current value of all properties is sent through the method `get(image, **kwargs)` as keyword arguments."
