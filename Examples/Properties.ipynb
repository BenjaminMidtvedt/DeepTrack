They represent a value,\nwhich can be of any data type. This value can be updated through a sampling rule which is\npassed to the class constructor on initialization. Concretely, a Property always has a value\naccessible through the `current_value` field. This value is updated whenever `update()` is\ncalled, and the new value is determined by the sampling rule passed as an input to the\nconstructor.\n\n## What is a sampling rule?\n\nA sampling rule, just like the `current_value` field, can be of any type. When a rule is\nsampled - that is, when you request it to create a new value - it runs through a series of \nchecks, executed in the folowing manner\n\n1.  If the sampling rule has a callable `sample` method, call it and return the output.\n2.  If the sampling rule is a dictionary, copy it and replace any value with a callable\n    `sample` method with the output of that call.\n3.  If the sampling rule is an iterable, return the next value.\n4.  If the sampling rule is callable, call it with no arguments and return the result.\n5.  If the sampling rule is either a ``list`` or a 1-dimensional ``ndarray``, extract one\n    element\n6.  If none of the above apply, return the sampling rule itself\n\nLet's run som examples to showcase some of these cases, starting by importing the necessary classes\n\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import sys\nsys.path.append(\"..\") # Adds the module to path\nfrom DeepTrack.properties import Property"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"### 1) Constant value\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"P = Property(1)\n\nprint(P.current_value)\nP.update()\nprint(P.current_value)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
