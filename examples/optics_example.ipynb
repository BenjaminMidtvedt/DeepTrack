    "## What is an optical device?\n",
    "\n",
    "Optical devices are implementations of the abstract class Features, which images its input through some optical setup. They treat the input as a discretization of the complex field scattered by a sample, and, unless otherwise stated, assumes the field is incoherent. \n",
    "\n",
    "An optical device can be added to a feature series in one main ways, F + optics, or optics(F). Both syntaxes will first resolve the feature F, followed by imaging the output through the optical device. The difference is that in the second syntax, the properties of the optical device is accessible by F. Most scatterers require this access to resolve, which is why the second syntax is preferred. "
