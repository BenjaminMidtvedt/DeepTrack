    "    \n",
    "1.  If the sampling rule has a method `sample()`, call `sample()` and return the output.\n",
    "2.  If the sampling rule is a dictionary, create an exact copy of the dictionary and substitute\n",
    "    any value that has a `sample()` method with the result of the call to this method.\n",
    "3.  If the sampling rule is either a ``list`` or a 1-dimensional ``ndarray``, extract one element randomly.\n",
    "4.  If the sampling rule is an iterable, return the next value.\n",
    "5.  If the sampling rule is callable, call it with no arguments and return the result.\n",
