    "Features are instances of the abstract class `Feature` and are responsible for modifying images. Each implementation of the class `Feature` needs to define a method `get(image, **kwargs)`, takes an image as an input and should return an updated image. This additive, such as adding a particle or gaussian noise, or non-additive, such as poisson noise or a low-pass filter. The image that is modified is in itself an instance of the class Image, which for now can be thought of as a normal numpy ndarray.\n",
